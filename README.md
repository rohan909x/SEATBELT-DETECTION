# SEATBELT-DETECTION
This project uses YOLOv8 for real-time seatbelt detection in vehicles. It processes video streams or images to identify whether drivers and passengers are wearing seatbelts. The system leverages OpenCV for video processing and the YOLOv8 model for object detection, ensuring fast and accurate results.
